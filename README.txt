GAME OVERVIEW:

The goal of the game is to run around the maze and shoot targets. Seems simple, but be careful! There are dragon statues around the maze that want to stop you from achieving your goal. And they are a lot less like statues and more like dragons... 

The player must destroy all 9 targets without getting killed by the dragons. If they complete this task, they will beat the game. Otherwise, it's not looking good for the player. The UI shows the player their health and the number of targets they have hit. 

CONTROLS:

Player Movement: Arrow Keys or WASD
Jump: Spacebar
Move Camera: Mouse or trackpad movement
Shoot: Click mouse or trackpad 


FEATURES:

Shoot at targets and gain points to win the game. 
Exciting "You Win!" screen with a large font.

KNOWN BUGS:

Jumping does not always respond on time. 
The health bar sometimes decrements by too much.
